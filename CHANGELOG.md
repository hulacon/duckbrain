# Changelog

Notable changes to duckbrain. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com);
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org).

duckbrain is distributed by `git clone` and served from a working copy, so most
users sit *between* releases. Provenance therefore records a `git describe` of the
actual checkout (e.g. `v0.1.0-3-gabc1234`), not the release number below — see
`core.bids_metadata._duckbrain_generated_by`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-16

First tagged release. Feature-complete across the three planned phases, with all
core stages validated live on Talapas against real data.

### Added
- **DICOM → BIDS ingestion and conversion** — DICOM sorter, inspector/classifier,
  and `dcm2bids` conversion. Validated end-to-end: output filename set is
  identical to canonical heudiconv output for the DIVATTEN dataset.
- **Preprocessing stages** — fMRIPrep, MRIQC, and NORDIC denoising, submitted via
  SLURM with dependency chaining. All validated live.
- **NORDIC → fMRIPrep chaining** — a per-project `[nordic] use_nordic` flag routes
  fMRIPrep through denoised data. NORDIC stays a pure producer; fMRIPrep's input
  is the only variable.
- **Pipeline cockpit (Project Status)** — a `(subject, session) × stage` matrix
  fusing filesystem completion with live SLURM state, with dependency-gated
  per-unit launching and a durable submission log.
- **Provenance recording** — every run records tool, version, runtime, and code
  source; duckbrain-produced derivatives carry BIDS `GeneratedBy`.
- **Consistency checker** — surfaces config-vs-provenance, container/toolbox/MATLAB
  drift, mixed provenance, staleness, and presence mismatches in the cockpit.
- **Open OnDemand app** — launches the GUI as a Batch Connect interactive app.
- **Streamlit GUI** — project setup, ingestion, conversion, preprocessing, QC, and
  job monitoring.

### Fixed
Notable bugs caught by live validation rather than unit tests:
- **MRIQC OOM** — the sbatch `--mem` and MRIQC `--mem-gb` came from one value, so
  MRIQC's soft target had no cgroup headroom. Decoupled (`--mem-gb` = alloc − 8G).
- **Surveyor false-green** — MRIQC graded complete on the anat T1w JSON alone, so
  func-crashed subjects read 🟢. Now requires func IQMs when the input has func.
- **NORDIC never ran** — three latent bugs: an m-file `DIROUT`/`fn_out` double
  path, a `{#` Jinja collision meaning the sbatch template had never rendered, and
  hardcoded `ses-` paths breaking sessionless data.
- **Provenance false positive** — drift compared a config-pinned container *tag*
  against a tool's *self-reported* version. Different namespaces: `mriqc-24.0.2.simg`
  reports `24.1.0.dev0+gd5b13cb5`. Now compares container identity.
- **Submission-log corruption** — appending a provenance row to a pre-provenance
  log made a ragged file `pd.read_csv` refuses, which would have taken down the
  log, Job Monitor, and every log-overlay check on the next launch. The header now
  migrates atomically before appending.

### Licensing
- Released under **GPL-3.0-or-later**. Supersedes an unbacked `license = "MIT"`
  claim in `pyproject.toml` (no `LICENSE` file had ever existed).
